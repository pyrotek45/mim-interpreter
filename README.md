# mim-interpreter

The mim interpreter is a toy language. Its main purpose was to be fun to create and to also learn about parsing interpreters. Mim's parsing is parsed mainly by splits, however I would like to change the parsing to something like a tokenizer in the future. Its design is based on having a single register to operate with, with the ability to create a range of variables that can be used to store data. It can create pseudo-functions by using the "smd" and "emd" commands.
